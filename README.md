# Space

_Space_ was a school project for the programming languages course. At that time, Python was new to me, and in general, anything related to programming. The best (and most fun) idea I came up with to complete my project was to make a video game.This is the result of that project. 

I have learned many things along the way and I like to come back here to see how my programming skills have improved.

This is the first and, so far, the only project that I have completed in Python.

## Install dependencies

```bash
# Activate the venv
source bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run 

```bash
# Running the project
python3 init

# ...or running legacy (original) source code
python3 space_legacy
```

## Stop venv
```bash
deactivate
```
